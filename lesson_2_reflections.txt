What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Answer: Initializing a repository adds a new hidden file to the directory named .git.
To do this you only need to type "git init" within the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Answer: The staging area only contains the files from the working directory that you
want to commit. While the repository contains files that have already been committed.
The staging area ensures that you can select the files from the working directory that
you want to commit and that you don't have to commit all the files in the working director
all at once

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Every logical change should be added singly from the working directory to the working area.
And each one should be singly committed to the repository.
