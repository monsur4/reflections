When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
Answer: a situation may arise whereby you have no access to your local computer,
in such a case you can add files directly to your remove repository. Secondly,
if the files you want to add to your remote repository is a simple text file
not requiring any codes then there is no point going through the process of first
creating it in your local repository and then pushing it to GitHub when you can
just create a new text file directly on GitHub and save you the time and stress.
That's what I think!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes manually allows you to carefully select the changes that you
would want to have in your local repository instead of all the changes being
added for you.
