When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
Answer: a situation may arise whereby you have no access to your local computer,
in such a case you can add files directly to your remove repository. Secondly,
if the files you want to add to your remote repository is a simple text file
not requiring any codes then there is no point going through the process of first
creating it in your local repository and then pushing it to GitHub when you can
just create a new text file directly on GitHub and save you the time and stress.
That's what I think!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes manually allows you to carefully select the changes that you
would want to have in your local repository instead of all the changes being
added for you.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
A fork is simply a clone from one GitHub repository to another GitHub repository.
It is a term reserved for such actions on GitHub. A clone is simply a copy of a
GitHub repository to your local computer or a copy from one part of your computer
to another. Finally, branches are a diversion from the main line of commit
(called master). They are used for experimental changes of trying out new features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored
locally?
Well, knowing where your origin/master branch (or remote commit) starts
from allows you to at least remember that you've not pushed your changes to the
remote GitHub repository yet. That way you don't forget to include the changes in
to GitHub repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and
what would be harder?
If you mean online, then you may collaborate by making changes in a file and
highlight the changes you've added while crossing out what you deleted. There has
to be a way for those you're collaborating with to understand the changes you are
making. And it could be much stress. This git and GitHub method is a generalized
and easy way. Maybe something else that's easier can be made in the future, but
right now I don't know any other easier way. The method I described above would be
harder
